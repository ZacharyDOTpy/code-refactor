# Code Refactor

## Description

In this first challenge I refactored the code on this webpage so that it has proper semantics so that elements behave as they would be expected to. I improved the search engine optimization by adding a proper title to the webpage and adding alt tags to images for screen readers. Finaly I applied the DRY principle by simplifying class selectors throughout my CSS stylesheet.
